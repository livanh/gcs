To install gcs, simply run

    $ make install

from the source directory. At the moment, gcs can only be installed under your $HOME directory because some
paths are hard-coded. This will probably change in the future.
You may need to add $HOME/bin to your $PATH. The easiest way is to add the following code at the end of
your .bashrc file, then open a new shell:

if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi
