Global Color Scheme (GCS) is a tool to change the color scheme of your Linux
desktop. It can take care of general purpose toolkits (like GTK) as well as
specific applications which have their own color settings. The purpose of GCS
is to configure every configurable color in your desktop in a consistent
manner and with a single command.

GCS is easily extensible, so if some program you use is not supported, you
can easily create a module for it (and if you send it to me, I'll consider
adding it to the codebase).


*** ALPHA STAGE WARNING!!! ***

SOMETHING UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS! I'M NOT KIDDING!
